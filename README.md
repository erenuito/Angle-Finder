# Angle-Finder
Angle Finder using OpenCV and Python
Used Python 3.7
Do not forget to install necessary libraries.
Do not forget to change the line 52. You must add a path.
I add a sample photo to try codes. You can change the line 52 as a ----> image_path = "path/sample-photo.png" and try codes.
It is easy to change colours:)
If you have a problem contact me:)
